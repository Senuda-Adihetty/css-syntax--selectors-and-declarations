<h1>Syntax (selector/Declarations)</h1>

<p>A CSS rule has two main parts: a selector, and one or 
more declarations:</p>

## The selector- <br>
HTML element you want to style.

## Declaration - <br>
consists of a property and a value.
The property is the style attribute you want to change. 
Each property has a value.
A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and 
declaration groups are surrounded by curly brackets:
<p><b>p {color:red;text-align:center;}</b></p>

<h1>• The id and class Selectors</h1>
<p>• In additionto the HTML element, CSS allows you to 
specify your own selectors called "id" and "class".
</p>

##   • The id Selector

<p>• The id selector is used to specify a style for a single, 
unique element.</p>
<p>• The id selector uses the id attribute of the HTML 
element, and is defined with a "#".</p>
<p>• The style rule above will be applied to the element 
with id="para1"</p>

##   • The class Selector
<p>• The class selector is used to specify a style for a 
group of elements. </p>
<p>• This allows you to set a particular style for many 
HTML elements with the same class. </p>
<p>• The class selector uses the HTML class attribute 
and is defined with a "."</p>
<p>• In the example above, all HTML elements with 
class="center" will be center-aligned:</p>
<p>• You can also specify that only specific HTML 
elements should be affected by a class.</p>
<p>• In the example above, all p elements with 
class="center" will be center-aligned:</p>
